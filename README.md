Custom Input Manager configuration to use Joycon as a controller for unity.

The Joycon's small footprint make them handy for Unity development with a
controller on the go!

To use, replace your InputManager.asset file in the ProjectSettings
directory of your project with the InputManager.asset file provided
here.

This configuration treats the right and left Joycon as a single controller.
The configuration assumes the left Joycon was paired before the right Joycon.

TODO:
* add support for single Joycon as controller
* better names for Joycon axes
* ensure that Joycon are actually paired?
